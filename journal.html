<h2>My Entry #1</h2>

<p>In my first couple classes I have started to learn the basics of coding and understanding coding language. The thing we have emphasized the most is divs, style types, head, and body. These things are commonly seen in code, and kind of break up how things are written out (if that makes sense?). I started to see how these work when making my namecard. In order to make it, I had to find a cool gif and photo to put on the cover. Now that it is done, I realize that coding is pretty simple in the manner that you just have to tell the computer exactly what to do. On the other hand, it seems very difficult to have all the body types memorized and be able to locate a problem, because one little thing can mess a lot up.
